# Declaration Files & Type-only Imports

<pre>
\\# Create a standard tsconfig.json file
yarn tsc --init
</pre>

We need to modify the tsconfig.json file since the initialized one is too permissive for production use.

<pre>
...
...
// The property \\"target\\" is the language level that we wish to support.
// This is not the language level allowed in your code. This is the language
// level we will be compiling out to.
// Change from \\"es2015\\" to \\"ES2018\\"
\\"target\\": "ES2018",
...
...
// Enable types: type declaration files to be included in compilation.
\\"types\\": [],
...
...
// Change the output directory from \\"./\\" to \\"dist\\".
// TypeScript compiler by default will put the output JavaScript file and type
// declaration file as siblings of the TypeScript compiler input file. This
// might complicate things when we want to clear the output files since they
// they are in the same folder as the source file.
\\"outDir\\": \\"dist\\",
...
...
// This controls the folder structure within the dist folder.
// If we have an index.ts file in src folder, we will have an index.js in dest
// folder.
\\"rootDir\\": \\"src\\",
...
...
// Disable skipLibCheck
...
...
// Enable declaration since we are building a library and we want to generate
// .d.ts files.
...
...
// Enable strict.
...
...
// Add stripInternal: take out \\@Internal annotated fields from the type
// declaration file.
\\"stripInternal\\": true,
...
...
// At the end of the file, add the following:
\\"include\\": [\\"src\\"]
