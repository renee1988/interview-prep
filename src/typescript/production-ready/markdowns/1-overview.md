# TypeScript Is ...
* A programming language, a compiler and a language server
  * Language server: serves autocompletes in VS code
* A syntactic superset of JavaScript
  * It builds on top of the existing JavaScript syntax
* The core of the best JS environment available today
* "A fancy linter" and a fantastic static analysis tool
  * Type checking
  * Make sure you are following through the garuantees you intend to make

# What problems does TS help solve?
* Duck typed languages start to hurt more as codebases get large
  * hard to keep contracts between modules under control
* Informal contracts grow organically, formal ones grow deliberately
* JS authoring environments are worlds behind the UX of "modern IDEs"
* Too many JS errors are discovered at *runtime*.
