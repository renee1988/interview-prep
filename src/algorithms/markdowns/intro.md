## Motivation
As a front-end engineer, algorithms and data structures are just as important if not more. I **ABSOLUTELY DONâ€™T** agree that there is no need for front end engineers to pay attention to which data structures / algorithms to use when it comes to front-end component implementations. In fact, I think it is one of the most crucial criteria of a high-quality front-end component. That said, I **DONâ€™T** feel the need to practice all the Leetcode problems to succeed in any technical interviews. As an interviewer, I often pay much more attention to intervieweeâ€™s problem solving skills:
- How well does the interviewee understand the problem definition?
- Does the interviewee have the ability to identify which data structure to use to solve the problem?
    - Ability to analyze time and space complexities of each data structure candidate
- Can the interviewee clearly communicate his/her thoughts / algorithm to the interviewer?
- How does the interviewee test his/her solution?

## Misunderstanding
Often people think the only way to succeed in an interview is to provide a highly optimized solution, meaning if you fail to do so, you fail the interview. If this is true, I probably would have failed most of the interviews I did with Facebook, Google, Uber, Amazon and Microsoft. Surprisingly, I got offers from all the companies listed above ðŸ˜€.
- There are questions designed to be very difficult, if you can code it up within 45 minutes and without any bug, it is highly possible that you have practiced this question. In this case, the interviewer wonâ€™t get a clear signal how good you are.
- There are questions designed to not have an optimal solution, it is open-ended, and often require algorithm design tweaks based on different conditions.
