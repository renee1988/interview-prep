It is not multi-threaded. You can spin up two NodeJS instances that run on different processes, but within a single execution context of JavaScript, it is single-threaded. The way JavaScript handles the asynchronous code is in an event loop:</p> <ul> <li>it does single-threaded execution</li> <li>it has different operations in different queues that it might choose to do</li> <li>it will only do it one at a time</li> <li>For example, NodeJs, you can think of it as a big pool of connections asking for things, and NodeJs has an ordered way to handle these requests/tasks. It can switch quickly between different queued tasks. UI Thread is single-threaded, there are several different systems inside the browser that are all sharing the same thread, meaning they can have only one of the tasks from these systems at a time.</li> <li>CSS rendering engine</li> <li>JS engine</li> <li>DOM</li> <li>Garbage collector For example, if the JS engine is executing some task at a given moment, but CSS rendering engine comes in and wants to repaint a frame at the same moment, CSS rendering engine has to wait for the JS engine to finish its ongoing task.</li> </ul> <h3 id="threaded-javascript---web-worker">\u201cThreaded\u201d JavaScript - Web worker</h3> <p>Web worker allows you to point to a particular JavaScript file and run it in a different thread.

However, as soon as that communication needs to come back to the JS engine, <strong>it has to wait for the JS engine to have a free cycle</strong>. The JS engine won\u2019t have a free cycle until the UI thread is free. While if the request comes back to JS engine but there is a CSS animation going on in the UI thread, your request won\u2019t be handled until the CSS engine finishes its ongoing task.</li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Followup: In this case, it sounds like we should just use web workers always. <strong>Answer</strong>: the communication channel between the main thread and the web worker is <strong>STRING</strong> based, and it is <strong>COPY-ONLY</strong>. Therefore if you have a lot of data to send, you end up with two copies of data in memory until the garbage collector comes along clear them out.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="dynamic-memory-allocation---garbage-collector">Dynamic Memory Allocation - Garbage collector</h3> <p>JavaScript allows you to create variables, elements in the DOM, and it allows you to not delete those variables but simply to stop referencing them.</p> <pre><code class="language-javascript">var obj = {\n    // ... lots of data, e.g., 1MB of data\n};\n// ... later\nobj = null; // &lt;- here we are setting the reference to null, not the object itself.\n// What happens to that 1MB chunk of data?\n// Someone has to come along and free up the memory.</code></pre> <p>Garbage collection is one of the tasks run in the UI thread. The more often the browser thinks the garbage collector needs to run, the more your code will be affected negatively performance-wise.</p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <ul> <li>HTTP Archive: <a

</ul> <h2 id="request-and-response-multiplexing">Request and response multiplexing</h2> <h3 id="with-http1x">With HTTP/1.x</h3> <ul> <li>if the client wants to make multiple parallel requests to improve performance, multiple TCP connections must be used.</li> <li>only one response cane be delivered at a time (response queuing) per connection.</li> </ul> <h3 id="with-http20">With HTTP/2.0</h3> <ul> <li>request and response multiplexing allows client and server to break down an HTTP message into independent frames, interleave them, and then reassemble them on the other end.</li> </ul> <h2 id="stream-prioritization">Stream prioritization</h2> <ul> <li>Each stream may be assigned an integer weight between 1 and 256</li> <li>Each stream may be given an explicit dependency on another stream</li> </ul> <h2 id="one-connection-per-origin">One connection per origin</h2> <ul> <li>Most HTTP transfers are short and bursty, whereas TCP connection is optimized for long-lived, bulk data transfers.</li> <li>Reusing the same connection reduces the overall protocol overhead and memory and processing footprint along the full connection path (i.e., client --- ... --- server)</li> </ul> <h2 id="flow-control">Flow control</h2> <p>Flow control prevents the sender from overwhelming the receiver with data that may not want / be able to process:</p> <ul> <li>client may have requested a large video stream with high priority but the user pauses the video and the client now wants to pause or throttle its delivery from server.</li> <li>a proxy server may have a fast downstream and slow upstream connections, wants to regulate how quickly the downstream delivers data to match the speed of upstream to control its resource usage.</li> </ul> <h2 id="server-push">Server push</h2> <ul> <li>Server can send multiple responses for a single request.<ul> <li>inlined CSS, Javascript or any other assets via a data URI:<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;img

<ul> <li>HTTP/2.0 compresses request and response header metadata using HPACK compression format:<ul> <li>header fields are encoded via a static Huffman code.</li> <li>both client and server maintain and update an indexed list of previously seen header fields, establishes a shared compression context.</li> </ul> </li> <li>static table provides a list of common HTTP header fields.</li> <li>dynamic
